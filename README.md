## Abstract

In recent years, reversible data hiding in encrypted domain (RDH-ED) has garnered considerable interest among researchers, resulting in the development of high-performance methods based on various carriers. However, the challenge of enhancing the data embedding capacity while ensuring reversibility becomes increasingly pronounced when the carrier is a three-dimensional (3D) model. In this paper, a high capacity RDH-ED method based on dynamic prediction and virtual connection for 3D models is proposed. Unlike existing methods that partition the vertices in the model into embeddable and prediction sets, where each vertex can only serve one function, the proposed dynamic prediction mechanism constructs a data embedding order set by leveraging the connectivity relationships between vertices. This allows each vertex within the set to both embed data and provide predictions, significantly increasing the proportion of embeddable vertices. Moreover, the proposed method is the first work to consider independent vertices within the model and integrates a novel virtual connection approach with the dynamic prediction process, enabling all independent vertices to participate in data embedding and prediction, thereby further enhancing the data embedding capacity. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of data embedding capacity while ensuring reversibility.
